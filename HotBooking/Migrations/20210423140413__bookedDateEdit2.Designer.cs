Spain is a lot more than 'sun, sea, sand and sangria' – a stereotype that could not be further from the truth.

From the pre-Romanesque ruins of northern Asturias, to Segovia’s fully intact Roman aqueduct, southern Andalucia’s majestic Moorish palaces and countless monumental cathedrals built by the all-conquering Christians, every civilisation has left its mark. The cosmopolitan capital, Madrid, buzzes with energy, while the extraordinary architecture of Barcelona justifies a visit to the Iberian Peninsula all on its own. You'll be in awe as you gaze up at the intricately carved ceilings of Antoni Gaudí’s magnificent Sagrada Família. And to experience Spain’s infinite adventure playground, go hiking, skiing, climbing or kayaking in mountain ranges like The Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa. But Spain is not just a nirvana for naturalists and history buffs. Sights like Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum, Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences and Madrid’s Prado Museum prove it’s also a centre of innovation and cutting-edge art. Two of the world’s most renowned surrealist artists also hail from Spain – you can visit Salvador Dali’s self-designed museum in his hometown of Figueres in Catalonia, as well as Pablo Picasso’s birthplace in Málaga, Andalucia. But, lest we forget, Spain is also home to some of Europe’s finest white-sand beaches, which draw the bulk of visitors to its sun-kissed coastlines. Join the masses on the Costa del Sol, or strike out to the virtually undeveloped Costa de Almeria, where pristine, often empty stretches abound.

On the East Coast, glance up at the iconic skyscrapers of New York and chow down on lobster in Boston. On the West Coast, stroll San Francisco's crazy, twisty streets and visit the real La La land of Los Angeles. While inland, roll the dice in glittering Las Vegas. You'll find a different America at each world-famous city. Then there's the breathtaking, epic vistas. Countless. There's a reason why road trips hold such appeal. Head north to draw breath at Alaska's wilderness and majestic peaks of the Rockies, hike the glories of its famed national parks Yosemite and Yellowstone, look up at the towering rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, take in the sublime countryside of New England on the East Coast... just a few of its natural wonders. And with so many hotels here, from popular chains to world-class accommodation, cheap motels to beach resorts, you'll always find the right accommodation for you.",

Spain is a lot more than 'sun, sea, sand and sangria' – a stereotype that could not be further from the truth.

From the pre-Romanesque ruins of northern Asturias, to Segovia’s fully intact Roman aqueduct, southern Andalucia’s majestic Moorish palaces and countless monumental cathedrals built by the all-conquering Christians, every civilisation has left its mark. The cosmopolitan capital, Madrid, buzzes with energy, while the extraordinary architecture of Barcelona justifies a visit to the Iberian Peninsula all on its own. You'll be in awe as you gaze up at the intricately carved ceilings of Antoni Gaudí’s magnificent Sagrada Família. And to experience Spain’s infinite adventure playground, go hiking, skiing, climbing or kayaking in mountain ranges like The Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa. But Spain is not just a nirvana for naturalists and history buffs. Sights like Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum, Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences and Madrid’s Prado Museum prove it’s also a centre of innovation and cutting-edge art. Two of the world’s most renowned surrealist artists also hail from Spain – you can visit Salvador Dali’s self-designed museum in his hometown of Figueres in Catalonia, as well as Pablo Picasso’s birthplace in Málaga, Andalucia. But, lest we forget, Spain is also home to some of Europe’s finest white-sand beaches, which draw the bulk of visitors to its sun-kissed coastlines. Join the masses on the Costa del Sol, or strike out to the virtually undeveloped Costa de Almeria, where pristine, often empty stretches abound. Spain offers practically every kind of accommodation imaginable, from high-end hotels and luxury villas, to friendly B&Bs, cheap hostels and remote eco-lodges.",

Russia’s long and intriguing history is the top draw for most visitors, and this is showcased beautifully in its main cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The former, Russia’s mammoth capital, is home to the iconic Red Square – take a stroll along its black cobblestones and soak up the far-reaching brick walls of the Kremlin, Saint Basil’s Cathedral and Lenin’s Mausoleum. The Hermitage in Saint Petersburg offers a vast collection of treasures, ranging from Roman coins to prehistoric art. Both cities serve up delicious local dishes such piroshki (small pies with various fillings) or national delicacy caviar – best paired with a good vodka. For the intrepid traveller exploring Russia’s wild side, endless adventures await. A ride along the Trans-Siberian Railway is something on many a bucket list. The longest railway route in the world crosses seven time zones and lets you explore the dramatic scenery of Siberia. At the outer limits of the Far East, the acid lakes, volcanoes and Valley of the Geysers feature along the 1,250 km-long peninsula of Kamchatka. Russia’s accommodation choices are as wide as its geography, with hordes of hotels, hostels, apartments and guest houses scattered all over.

Come in summer and be rewarded with picturesque views of emerald lakes backed by glinting glaciers, and sightings of grizzly bears, wolves and moose roaming through the forest.
